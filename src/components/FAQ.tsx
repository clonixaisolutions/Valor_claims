    question: "What is a public insurance adjuster?",
    answer: "A public insurance adjuster is a licensed professional who works exclusively for policyholders, not insurance companies. We assess property damage, prepare and document claims, and negotiate with insurance companies to ensure you receive the maximum settlement you're entitled to under your policy.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to hire a public adjuster?",
    answer: "We work on a contingency fee basis, meaning we only get paid when you receive your settlement. There are no upfront costs or out-of-pocket expenses. Our fee is a percentage of your final settlement, and we'll discuss this transparently before beginning work on your claim.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does the claims process take?",
    answer: "The timeline varies depending on the complexity of your claim and your insurance company. Simple claims may be resolved in a few weeks, while more complex cases involving significant damage can take several months. We work diligently to expedite the process while ensuring you receive fair compensation.",
  },
  {
    question: "What types of damage do you handle?",
    answer: "We handle all types of property damage claims including fire, water, wind, hurricane, storm, hail, flooding, vandalism, theft, and more. Whether it's residential or commercial property, we have the expertise to handle your claim effectively.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help if my claim was already denied?",
    answer: "Yes! We often help clients whose claims were initially denied or undervalued by insurance companies. We can review your case, identify issues, and work to appeal the decision or reopen negotiations to get you the settlement you deserve.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be present during the inspection?",
    answer: "Yes, we strongly recommend that you be present during the inspection. Your presence ensures clear communication, allows you to understand the findings firsthand, and helps us address any questions or concerns in real time.",
